CS2 Resolution Manager is a utility designed to streamline and enhance resolution management for Counter-Strike 2. It allows users to set, save, and apply custom resolutions effortlessly, ensuring consistent display settings even when tabbing in and out of fullscreen mode. The program modifies system display settings and game configuration files to prevent Windows from reverting to the native resolution, providing a smoother gaming experience. Additionally, it includes an auto-launch feature that enables the game to start automatically with the userâ€™s preferred resolution, simplifying the setup process.
